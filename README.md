# Gender Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project was proudly presented at the **2024 Kansas Capitol Graduate Research Summit**, earning recognition from the **State of Kansas**, the **Kansas Governor**, policymakers, and **Fort Hays State University** for its significant contribution to research and innovation.

## Project Overview
Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify a person's gender from facial images, achieving an impressive **91% validation accuracy** using a dataset of over **23,000 images**. The CNN model was trained to recognize and distinguish between male and female faces with high precision, and the results were validated against a separate test set.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Utilizes CNN for image recognition, which is highly effective in identifying facial features for gender classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **91% validation accuracy** on a large dataset, demonstrating the modelâ€™s robustness and reliability.
- **Scalability**: The model can be extended to classify other facial attributes or be integrated into larger facial recognition systems.

## Applications
This research has potential applications in:  
- **Demographic Analysis**: Gain insights into population demographics by understanding gender distribution.
- **Targeted Advertising**: Deliver personalized ad content based on user gender classification.
- **Security Enhancements**: Improve surveillance systems by adding gender classification to identity verification processes.
- **Personalized User Experiences**: Tailor services such as online recommendations and customizations based on gender.
- **Medical Diagnostics**: Support healthcare assessments, providing tools to analyze patients' gender in clinical studies.

## Methodology
The CNN model was trained on a large dataset of facial images and utilized the following steps:

### Sample Characteristics
The dataset consists of over **23,000 facial images** annotated with gender labels. These images were sourced from various public datasets, ensuring diversity in terms of ethnicity, age, and lighting conditions, which contributed to the model's high generalization ability.

- **Sample Characteristics**:
  - Number of images: **23,000+**
  - Image dimensions: **200x200 pixels** (resized)
  - Labeling: **Male (0)** and **Female (1)** categories
  - Gender Distribution: **52.3% Male**, **47.7% Female**
  - Age Rage: **0 to 116 years**
  - Preprocessing steps: Normalization (standardized pixel values), augmentation (increased dataset variety), and grayscale conversion (reduced complexity) to improve model robustness.

### Image Preprocessing
To ensure consistent input to the model, the images were split into smaller chunks of 200x200 pixels to improve model performance and reduce computational load.

### CNN Model Architecture
The model follows a **standard CNN architecture**, featuring multiple layers for feature extraction and classification:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts image data (resized to 200x200 pixels).
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features such as edges, textures, and facial landmarks.
3. **Activation Functions**: Leaky ReLU to introduce non-linearity.
4. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality and capture the most important features.
5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify images into gender categories based on extracted features.
6. **Output Layer**: A sigmoid activation function for binary classification (Male/Female).
