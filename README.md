# Gender Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project was proudly presented at the **2024 Kansas Capitol Graduate Research Summit**, earning recognition from the **State of Kansas**, the **Kansas Governor**, policymakers, and **Fort Hays State University** for its significant contribution to research and innovation.

## Project Overview
Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify a person's gender from facial images, achieving an impressive **91% validation accuracy** using a dataset of over **23,000 images**. The CNN model was trained to recognize and distinguish between male and female faces with high precision, and the results were validated against a separate test set.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Utilizes CNN for image recognition, which is highly effective in identifying facial features for gender classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **91% validation accuracy** on a large dataset, demonstrating the modelâ€™s robustness and reliability.
- **Scalability**: The model can be extended to classify other facial attributes or be integrated into larger facial recognition systems.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of over **23,000 facial images** annotated with gender labels. These images were sourced from various public datasets, ensuring diversity in terms of ethnicity, age, and lighting conditions, which contributed to the model's high generalization ability.

- **Dataset Characteristics**:
  - Number of images: **23,000+**
  - Image dimensions: **64x64 pixels** (resized)
  - Labeling: **Male** and **Female** categories
  - Preprocessing steps: Normalization, augmentation, and grayscale conversion to improve model robustness.
